 makes you think, and it's funny because
 that this is not the form at all,

 thing and suddenly the hole remains
 something… something… Red is what I like
 serious discomfort",1,0,0,0,0
"So (points to the bottom)
 of the image), and it's a bit annoying
 so (laughs), but that makes me

 suddenly, (long pause) annoying more
 that creepy but hey…",1,1,0,0,0
"And then, it's a lot
 funnier like that, it makes me
 think of a camel, no
 camel because two humps, with the
 head here (shows) he doesn't have the

 head here and one, two bumps
 (shows), it obscures the thing a little

 table is tiny.
 But there you really have the server
 with head, arms on chair
 and with the legs and um there you go
 (shown in the image).˄ The tasks there don’t remind me of
 much",1,0,0,0,1
"And then like that, in
 that means, for me, an insect,
 big eyes there (points),
 mandibles there (shows), and the
 papattes there (shows). Once
 again, that implies concealing that (hide the two red spots

 stretching out behind like
 that (mimes), as if he were doing
 gym with legs in the air.
 (hides the bottom of the image with its

 but uh…. It's still doing well.

 shapes and proportions are not
 respected but that’s the thing I
 see in any case.˅ These tasks inspire me
 really not, nowhere do I see them
 in no stuff actually.",1,0,0,0,1

 style…",1,0,0,0,0

 think about… that the hollow, the two

 you had the change in density
 here (shows)",1,0,1,0,0

 it's shoulders that go up

 no, it's really confusing

 lake or something like that",1,0,1,0,0
"In fact, we have the impression
 whether it is a lake or a canal rather,
 This is the edge of the canal here
 (shows the line), so you have the
 reflection, which is funny because at night,
 you don't have a reflection because you don't have
 enough light but like
 it’s dark it makes you want
 to imagine the night.",1,0,1,0,0

 Batman too (laughs) Hm, that reminds me of the butterfly
 at night more than at Batman
 And the moth, and there I
 tell stories too, you see
 I told you I needed one
 little time to relax,
 I will have more things to say about
 last five so, I am
 sorry (laughs)
 Hum the atmosphere, the fact that we
 take a test, whether it is
 Rorschach so there is a more psychological test side than
 personality in my head but
 There
 The moth makes me
 think about, what is it called, the
 silence of the lambs, and all its
 theme around change and
 the evolution that I find for the
 very interesting shot and which is
 symbolized by the butterfly more than
 the moth but uh by the
 butterfly, from the side hum, caterpillar,
 chrysalis, and skin change
 you see. For once, the film is a
 a bit creepy but quite nice
 Afterwards, me, what
 -whatever it wants
 say in relation to me bah…. I
 I don't know but I'll share this with you
 what I think and it makes me think of
 That.
 Hmm, there you go
 Afterwards if I share more than that with you,
 it's more compared to the image
 but you have to tell me if it’s
 coherent or not because then I
 will talk less and less about
 the image. (answer: we need to talk about
 the image, what you see)
 The butterfly has weird eyes",1,0,0,0,0
"That for once (shows)
 it gives me a bit of chills down my spine

 parasites that you have in the
 insects in general

 normal because in fact there is a
 parasite that is inside",1,1,0,0,0

 take it in this direction, the opposite
 that would mean that he would already have
 took off, his wings are finally up

 tail she is more perfect",0,0,0,0,1

 weird and the eyes wouldn't be

 takes imagination but I know
 not if you see this photo where he is

 also works the other way",0,0,0,0,1
": There I see a chin, a
 mouth, a half nose...

 before, for now it's a bit
 plus, not a super pleasant image
 and pretty",0,0,0,1,0
"You have the impression there it is
 a…what do we call it, uh
 shit, a great piece of wood
 big one on which you cling,
 as if it were someone who
 was hooked on it because it
 would look more like arms that
 are tied behind, a bit like
 witch who is going to be burned
 And the fact that it's a little blurry
 reminds me of the witch side
 which has already started to burn a little
 what with the smoke
 It's less joyful, I
 preferred Freddy Mercury ˂ That said when he has a mouth
 closed, it does not seem to scream
 phew
 And there on the same principle, and it is
 funny I had to return it
 because I don't see it from that side,
 I really see the witch",1,0,1,0,1
"While on this side, we
 put Freddy Mercury there and see
 no longer anyone who is hooked and that's it
 no more pole dance, you have the bar And I think it's good yes, there
 has more inspiring ones than
 others",0,0,0,0,1
"First thing, it makes me
 think of a star wars ship
 the Xwing, well after that it is not
 exactly like that but this
 makes me think of it",0,0,0,1,0

 think of a fish (hide the bottom

 know the fish that fly there with
 so the wings are really there
 seen from above what, this side like
 from above",0,0,1,0,0
"And that all together gives me
 looks like a key
 It’s a bit of a weird key and
 so that… it’s just that she’s not
 not very long and you can imagine that
 blow (show) which is a little more
 elongate",0,0,0,1,0
"That reminds me of a
 tick with small teeth,
 hooks.It’s funny because I don’t
 only take parts of images",0,0,0,1,0
"Really in his
 together where it’s classiest
 It reminds me of a shore,
 anyway there is the mirror side which
 still often makes one think of
 that. Now even more peaceful
 than just now. Because everything
 the time you had, the side you
 you move away and you come closer, you
 see, you had a notion of
 depth",1,0,0,0,0
"But there you have more
 the impression that you are facing a
 lake. Yeah, that reminds me more of a lake. And so actually, it's like
 stagnant water.
 You see things like that
 (shows), the water is not agitated you
 see ",1,0,0,0,0
"But it still does
 think of a lake where like, it's raining
 what, there are like reeds,
 stuff like that
 Then it's more, I don't know
 what, I can imagine the rest,
 a plain or I don't know what
 (shows dark gray)",1,0,0,0,1
"And there you see it’s weird,
 because you have the change of
 colors, it’s like the sky
 (points to the top), and there you have
 grass with meadow in the distance
 flowery, stuff like that Once again it's zoomed in
 do. (Walks away in his chair with
 the board, puts it away from its
 eyes)
 Because it’s true that we could
 have fun looking at the image
 even further away and to which
 case… I don’t know if you see what
 I mean, I'm not walking away
 really but… if you change
 the scale in fact",1,0,1,0,0
"And this kind of small
 there, these clarifications,
 it could be city stuff
 done, squarely, in the distance and suddenly
 it has a very distant horizon and
 suddenly which explains why it is
 a little foggy
 Typically that would be more
 close, like you're coming, I don't know
 me on a boat, you arrive at something
 like that and you have the lights of the
 night once again But it's funny because in
 done, to be able to imagine that, that
 what I tend to do is
 imagine, finally compensate for the
 white actually. In my head, you
 see, that is to say that this part is not logical in this
 image that I evoked to you, if we
 try to make a picture of it uh...
 that's not logical so I'm hiding
 (pfiou-noise to remove it with its
 hand), because otherwise it loses a
 little of that…(shows where he puts
 gray)",1,0,1,0,0

 flames",1,0,0,0,0
"And so you're sure, I know
 not me like uh... an edge of
 uh... once again you have the side
 floats, and you have the forest side that burns
 what, summer fire or I don't know
 So it's much more
 coherent because it's smoke
 who starts from that",1,0,1,0,1
"That could be a line
 also, with the thing that stings but
 uh… generally it’s
 much finer though,
 but that's what.",0,0,0,1,0
