I know that when doing the DeepL API call you can pass a glossary as an argument to the function. Maybe I would be a good idea to make a glossary with more concrete terms if there are synonyms to those semantically ambiguous nouns. Alternative: look for a way to measure the specificity of a word to deal with those kinds of nouns/terms\n",

However, the potential use of cosine similarity would be comparing the noun phrases we got from the previous section and deleting the sentence in the pair which has the shortest length because the longer sentence may contain a bit more information, even if just by a marginal amount (as accounted by the cosine similarity)."
